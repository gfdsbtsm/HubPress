HubPress is tool to build static blog with Asciidoc content (thanks to @asciidoctor).

HubPress is actually in preview, if you find some bugs come to see us.

A complete documentation will come here soon.

To test HubPress, fork this repository and update the config.json file :

[source, shell]
----
{
  "meta": {
    "username": "put your username here",
    "repositoryName": "put your repository name here",
    "branch": "master"
    },
    "theme": {
      "name": "Casper"
    }
  }

  ----

  If you don't use the domain *<username>.github.io*, you must set branch to *gh-pages*.


  For the blog HubPress, same configuration file is :

  [source, shell]
  ----
  {
    "meta": {
      "username": "hubpress",
      "repositoryName": "blog.hubpress.io",
      "branch": "gh-pages"
      },
      "theme": {
        "name": "Casper"
      }
    }
    ----

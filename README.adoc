Created and maintained by http://github.com/anthonny[Anthonny Qu√©rouil] (twitter http://twitter.com/anthonny_q[@anthonny_q]).

NOTE: HubPress is actually in preview, if you find some bugs come to see us.

Complete documentation is coming here soon!

== Getting started

=== Installation
==== Fork the repository

If you already know GitHub, you know what to do.

For those not familiar with GitHub, click on the Fork icon :image:http://hubpress.io/img/fork-icon.png[Fork,80]

This will create a copy of this repository within your GitHub account.

==== Use the github.io domain

Here is the simplest way. Only a few steps are required. However, if you have a custom domain name, we recommend you use *gh-pages* (see below).

Firstly, you need to set some values in `hubpress/config.json`
:image:http://hubpress.io/img/edit-config.png[Edit config]

You have two values to set :

* `username`: it's your github username,
* `repositoryName`: it's the name of your fork, `hubpress.io` if you did not rename it.

Commit and open your website http://<username>.github.io, you'll see :

Congratulations, installation is done!

==== Use your own a custom domain

In the settings, set the default branch to *gh-pages* :

Switch your repository to the branch *gh-pages*

Set some values in `hubpress/config.json`
:image:http://hubpress.io/img/edit-config.png[Edit config]

You have two values to set :

* `username`: it's your github username,
* `repositoryName`: it's the name of your fork, `hubpress.io` if you did not rename it.

Commit and open your website http://<username>.github.io/<repositoryName>, you'll see :
